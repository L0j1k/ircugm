 * This utility is automated software used to idle in IRC servers and 
 * collect information about the users in a channel, then perform 
 * operations on the data so that it may be more easily visualized.
 * ircugm will attempt to "learn" things about the users in its assigned 
 * channel and make a certain amount of predictions about the users 
 * based on previous behavior and other metrics. It also produces pretty
 * output from the analyses and reports.
